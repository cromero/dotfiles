This directory contains env configuration files with options that are
specific to MAC. They rely on the central and more generic dot files
at the top level directory in this projcet. 

The best way to get all the env goodness configured in this set of dot
files is to add a simple line at the top of your ~/.profile like this:

source path/to/dotfiles/mac/dot_profile

You are then encouraged to add any configuration specific to your
environment to the ~/.profile file in that host
